      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>Poli-Info was founded in 2019, during the Web Develoupment class hosted by Kode with Klossy. The founders, Mimi Goodridge and Lauren Ravury, knew that young voters has were cheated of collective resources to learn about politics and how the U.S government works. Poli-Info's goal has been to inspire a new generation of voters to get up and vote! No matter what political party you are our goal is to inform others about the fatcs about politics, like whose running for president or where is the closest polling place near you.</p>
